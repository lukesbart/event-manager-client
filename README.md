Event Manager is a personal project written with an Express.JS backend, and a React Front End. The UI is built with Tailwind CSS. The navigation within the client side is built with React Router. Authentication for the app is provided by JSON Web Tokens in localStorage. This app allows an event manager to create different meetings for an event with file uploads including MP3, MP4, and PDF assets.
