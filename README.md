Event Manager is a personal project written with an Express.JS backend, and a React Front End. The UI is built with Tailwind CSS. The navigation within the client side is built with React Router. Authentication for the app is provided by JSON Web Tokens in localStorage. This app allows an event manager to create different meetings for an event with file uploads including MP3, MP4, and PDF assets.

## Motivation
My motivation for creating this project was from a previous experience that I had in creating a website. One of the first websites I ever created was for an event at a local church. In this project I tried to apply all of the things that I had learned since creating that first website to create what I would have wanted that website to be.
